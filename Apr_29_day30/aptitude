1.Three pipes A, B and C can fill a tank from empty to full in 30 minutes, 20 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively. When the tank is empty, all the three pipes are opened. A, B and C discharge chemical solutions P,Q and R respectively. What is the proportion of the solution R in the liquid in the tank after 3 minutes?

Rate of filling A: 1/30
Rate of filling B: 1/20
Rate of filling C: 1/10

Part filled by A+B+C in 3 mint = 3(1/30  + 1/20  + 1/10 ) = 3(11/60) == 11/20

filled by C in 3 mint = 3/10

required ratio : 3/10 * 20/11 == 6/11

ans = 6/11
